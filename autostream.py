#   @description: The all in one, break-the-algorithm, Spotify growth generator.
#   The music industry is about as corrupted and broken as modern government, if
#   not worse. Why sit back, spend hours, days, years of your life investing your 
#   time into your creative vision for it all to amount to nothing, because a 
#   pedophile with a few million dollars can pay his way to the top of a "Spotify
#   Curated" playlist with permanent residence.
#
#   Nooooo, but Daniel-fucking-Ek of a $4.5 billion net worth tells us that it's
#   not the service that's broken, musicians' expectations are whats wrong with
#   the industry, we just need to work harder!
#
#   Don't believe me? I don't blame you, you shouldn't believe everything you read
#   on the internet. I've yet to write a README doc with my "manifesto" about this
#   all, but for now feel free to refer to this article where I got the bit of info
#   above:

#   Suck my dick and choke on it you fucking troglodite. $4.5 billion but you can't 
#   spend a penny on getting a proper shave, evidently. 
#   
#   Anger aside, my message is simple: Fuck you, pay me. How many billions is enough, Ek?
