# Spoticry v0.0.1

The all in one, break-the-algorithm, Spotify growth generator.
The music industry is about as corrupted and broken as modern government, if
not worse. Why sit back, spend hours, days, years of your life investing your 
time into your creative vision for it all to amount to nothing, because a 
pedophile with a few million dollars can pay his way to the top of a "Spotify
Curated" playlist with permanent residence.

Nooooo, but Daniel-f\*\*\*ing-Ek of a $4.5 billion net worth tells us that it's
not the service that's broken, musicians' expectations are whats wrong with
the industry, we just need to work harder!

Don't believe me? I don't blame you, you shouldn't believe everything you read
on the internet. I've yet to write a README doc with my "manifesto" about this
all, but for now feel free to refer to this article where I got the bit of info
above:

Suck my d\*\*k and choke on it you f\*\*\*ing troglodite. $4.5 billion but you can't 
spend a penny on getting a proper shave, evidently. 
   
Anger aside, my message is simple: F\*\*\* you, pay me. How many billions is enough, Ek?


## Spoticry features:

### Full, measurable Spotify growth
If access is granted to your Spotify for Artists account, map out and calculate how you want the accounts to interract with yours, providing a clear readout for which streams were generated via the Spoticry program versus how many streams were organic. Data visualization for this is planned.

### Completely undetectable Spotify ghost accounts
Random event occurances that are calculated by the Spoticry library will allow you to keep your arsenal of Spoticry generated accounts without having to worry about takedown. From regularly updated and tested proxies, random playlist creation/deletion, percentage chances of following your artist/playlist (given parameter input), the ability to mask your purpose behind regular, to completely random listening patterns concerning repeats, shuffles, etc, your growth on Spotify will look as organic as any other up-and-coming artist. 

### Presave feature
Along with the protection of the ghost accounts, Spoticry will automate the presave feature, showing consistent and continuous engagement from your Spoticry fans. Presaves are essential to getting corporate recognition on Spotify, and Spoticry will allow for your success to be streamlined in this fashion.
