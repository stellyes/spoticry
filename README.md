# Spoticry v0.0.2

"Baby keem got issues and money can't solve them!" - Baby Keem, "STATS, DIE FOR MY BITCH"

## Proposed features:

### Full, measurable Spotify growth

If access is granted to your Spotify for Artists account, map out and calculate how you want the accounts to interract with yours, providing a clear readout for which streams were generated via the Spoticry program versus how many streams were organic. Data visualization for this is planned.

### Completely undetectable Spotify ghost accounts

Random event occurances that are calculated by the Spoticry library will allow you to keep your arsenal of Spoticry generated accounts without having to worry about takedown. From regularly updated and tested proxies, random playlist creation/deletion, percentage chances of following your artist/playlist (given parameter input), the ability to mask your purpose behind regular, to completely random listening patterns concerning repeats, shuffles, etc, your growth on Spotify will look as organic as any other up-and-coming artist.

### Presave feature

Along with the protection of the ghost accounts, Spoticry will automate the presave feature, showing consistent and continuous engagement from your Spoticry fans. Presaves are essential to getting corporate recognition on Spotify, and Spoticry will allow for your success to be streamlined in this fashion.

### International range

If I could launch this on multiple AWS EC2 regions... I'm literally sobbing that would be insane.
