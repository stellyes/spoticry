The all in one, break-the-algorithm, Spotify growth generator.
The music industry is about as corrupted and broken as modern government, if
not worse. Why sit back, spend hours, days, years of your life investing your 
time into your creative vision for it all to amount to nothing, because a 
pedophile with a few million dollars can pay his way to the top of a "Spotify
Curated" playlist with permanent residence.

Nooooo, but Daniel-f\*\*\*ing-Ek of a $4.5 billion net worth tells us that it's
not the service that's broken, musicians' expectations are whats wrong with
the industry, we just need to work harder!

Don't believe me? I don't blame you, you shouldn't believe everything you read
on the internet. I've yet to write a README doc with my "manifesto" about this
all, but for now feel free to refer to this article where I got the bit of info
above:

Suck my d\*\*k and choke on it you f\*\*\*ing troglodite. $4.5 billion but you can't 
spend a penny on getting a proper shave, evidently. 
   
Anger aside, my message is simple: F\*\*\* you, pay me. How many billions is enough, Ek?
