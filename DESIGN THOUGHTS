For running this in the cloud, dont waste your time with EC2 instances. Generating a simple HTTP API via AWS will accomodate for an as-needed, by request payment plan and will reduce costs greatly.
There are a few things that are troubling about this, though:
    There are definitely limitations with the spotify web api. If i can insure that im able to use the api to boot up multiple accounts in the same instance than that's ideal
    Ensuring this will work via lambda on aws. Lambda endpoints have limited capability, and I cant have the code wait around for a confirmation of play. I need to be checking the response code.
    How do I avoid tracking this all on the same API key? I need to request a key via a proxy at any given moment, spread it around the world. Tricky.
